# Huffman Encoder-Decoder

This small nodejs application uses a Huffman tree to encode/decode text. 

It is suggested that you make use of the [Huffman-Tree Generator](https://github.com/TiagoDeMatosDias/Huffman-Tree-Generator) application to generate the Huffman tree.

# Folder explanation

The Huffman_Tree folder contains the huffman tree that will be used to compress/decompress the files.

The Encoder folder contains the code for the encoder, as well as the input text that will be compressed. Simply run the encoder.js file to output the compressed form of the encoderInput.txt file into the Outputs folder.

The Decoder folder contains the code for the decoder, as well as the input text that will be uncompressed. Simply run the decoder.js file to output the uncompressed form of the decoderInput.txt file into the Outputs folder.
